# camera
A skilled thief plans to rob a marble shop. To carry out a perfect robbery, first of all, he must know the location of the CCTV cameras in this store.

He has obtained valuable information by doing a lot of research with his X-ray equipped satellite. Because he researched from above and with a satellite, he sees the store as a Cartesian coordinate plane where the south and west walls of the store are the x and y coordinates. He knows that there are 4 cameras in this store, the coordinates of which are 4 cameras, the coordinates of the 4 vertices of a rectangle on this coordinate plane, whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.

The thief was able to understand the coordinates of 3 out of 4 cameras with a lot of research. But it was very difficult for him to understand the location of the fourth camera! By entering these 3 coordinates, tell him the coordinates of the fourth camera.
# input

The input consists of three lines. In each line, there are two numbers xx and yy (with a space between them), which are the coordinates of one of the cameras. It is guaranteed that these 3 coordinate points are for the three vertices of a rectangle whose area is greater than zero.
# output

In the only output line, print two numbers with at least one space, representing the xx and yy of the fourth camera, respectively.
